Problem â€“     The problem is that many developing countries heavily rely on traditional energy sources like coal and oil, which not only contribute to
                  environmental degradation and climate change but also affect the health of individuals and communities. Additionally, these traditional energy 
                  sources can be expensive, which limits access to electricity for people living in poverty. because of industrialization, the daily energy use has      
                  increased, and the carbon accumulation of people has also increased.

Solution-   Using a carbon calculator that allows users to input their daily activities such as transportation, energy usage calculates their carbon footprint 
                  based on their inputs. The app could provide users with personalized recommendations on how to reduce their carbon footprint based on their                 
                  inputs in the carbon calculator. The app could have a community support feature where users can connect with like-minded individuals and   
                  share their experiences on reducing their carbon footprint. The app could have a feature that allows users to purchase carbon offsets to 
                  neutralize their carbon footprint. The app could provide users with various offset options such as reforestation projects, renewable energy 
                  initiatives, and sustainable agriculture programs. Users could select the option that aligns with their interests and values and make a            
                 contribution directly through the app.
